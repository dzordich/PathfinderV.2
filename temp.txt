I have found that constant communication with team members, openness to changes to requisites and new ideas or solutions, keeping the backlog and the code itself as simple as possible, and always focusing on delivering working code yields the most efficient workflow and the highest quality product. Often, individuals or teams can become fixated with one approach to a problem, while a different approach may be a much simpler solution. Likewise, an overcluttered backlog slows down results and can lead to a lack of flexibility for changes to the product or requisites. Organized, fluid workflow is critical
